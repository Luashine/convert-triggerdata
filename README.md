# GUI Trigger Data Converter for WC3

## Localization versioning

### worldeditstrings.txt

This file on its own is of little importance, although it contains important terminology, it totally lacks the GUI triggers.

- w3t-1.31.1: has enus, zhcn, kokr. Everything else empty strings
- w3-1.30.4.11274: has ruru
- wc3-1.30.0.9900: has ruru (fully translated, even the JassHelper strings)
- 1.27-de: is German

*It was a deliberate decision by management to remove the (partial) translations for some reason. Only zh-CN remained in later versions.*

### triggerstrings.txt

Looks like it was never translated by official distributors.

There exist:

- A fixed version of the [1.26 English WorldEditor strings by PT153](https://xgm.guru/p/wc3/englify-we-1-26).
- A Russian translation of [WorldEditor up to 1.36 by Sinistra](https://xgm.guru/p/wc3/RusWorldEditor).
